TechCon 2024 Website Project

Hi there! This project is all about building a complete website for the TechCon 2024 conference. The website will have five main pages that cover everything from an introduction to the event, to how to register and contact the organizers.

Project Scope
Here’s what I’m creating:
Homepage (index.html)  
This is the main landing page. It will introduce TechCon 2024 and help visitors find their way to other pages on the site.

About Page (about.html)
I’ll share the history, mission, and some of the awesome speakers who will be at TechCon.

Schedule Page (schedule.html)
This page will have a clear and detailed schedule of all the events, sessions, and speakers. I’ll use a table to keep it nice and easy to read.

Register Page (register.html) 
I’ll make a registration form here so that attendees can sign up for the conference.

Contact Page (contact.html)
This page will have all the ways to get in touch with TechCon, including email, social media, a map to the venue, and a simple contact form.



What I’m Learning

During this project, I’m practicing and improving my HTML skills, including:

HTML Structure
Using tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>` to organize my pages properly.
Headings and Text
Learning how to use headings (`h1` to `h6`) and paragraphs (`<p>`) to make my content clear and readable.
Links and Navigation 
Adding links (`<a>` tags) so visitors can easily move between pages.
Tables 
Building a table to show the conference schedule in a neat and organized way.
Forms 
Creating simple and user-friendly forms for registration and contact, using different types of inputs.
Images and Multimedia
Using images (`<img>`) with good `alt` text, adding a video to promote the event, and embedding a Google Map with `<iframe>` to help people find the venue.



Final Goal

By the end of this project, I’ll have a fully working website for TechCon 2024! I’m excited to practice my HTML skills and build a website that’s clear, informative, and easy to use.

Thanks for checking out my project.
